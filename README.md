The aim of this project is to present an overall design of an automated dual axis solar tracking system using a four quadrant light dependent resistor(L.D.R) and electronic circuit to provide as a new system performance.The proposed system uses the tracker to actively track the solar radiation and accordingly adjust the panel to maximize the power output.The project focuses on the simulation and implementation of the most efficient algorithm on the dual axis solar tracker which rotates in azimuthand elevation direction.This simulation positions the panel in a hemispherical rotation absorbing maximum solar irradiation thus increasing the total electricity generation.
